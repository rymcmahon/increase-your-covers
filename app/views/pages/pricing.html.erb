  <ol>
    <li class="objections-questions">Is email marketing really effective?</li>
    <p class="objections-answers">Email marketing provides a greater return on investment than ANY other marketing. But don’t just take
    our word for it. Checkout Campaign Monitor’s <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2016/01/70-email-marketing-stats-you-need-to-know/" class="link-accent">Email Marketing Stats for 2016.</a> Our favorite is #54: <strong id="email-quote">“For every $1 spent,
    email marketing generates $38.”</strong> That’s a return on investment of 3,700%!</p>
    <li class="objections-questions">Can’t I just use a simple website from one of those other providers?</li>
    <p class="objections-answers">Typical web design solutions only focus on the visual, but your website needs to be a
    tool that funnels customers to you restaurant—not just a collection of pages that display hours of operation
    and your location. Our website development is focused on one goal: driving business through your doors. </p>
    <li class="objections-questions">What do you know about the restaurant business?</li>
    <p class="objections-answers">Our founder has worked in all areas of the restaurant business—from dishwasher to line cook to front
    the house management—and we use this experiece to craft marketing campaigns and websites that solve the problems faced by all restaurants. </p>
    <li class="objections-questions">Can I afford to spend $249 per month on a website and online marketing?</li>
    <p class="objections-answers">Yes! Even if our service only drives 10 customers to your restaurant per month (we expect many more) and each one spends $30, that’s $300 in revenue—a 20% return on your investment.</p>
    <li class="objections-questions">What if I am unhappy?</li>
    <p class="objections-answers">Cancel at any time...</p>

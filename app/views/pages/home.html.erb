  <h4 class="home-headlines center">Are your restaurant’s covers low because you’re not using online marketing and your website properly?</h4>
  <p class="home-copy">Are you harnessing the immense potential of email marketing to grow your customer base and keep them coming back? Is your website designed to merely look pretty, or was it built to drive new business to your restaurant?</p>
  <p class="home-copy">If you aren’t leveraging email marketing and don’t have a website that was built to convert visitors into customers, then you are missing out on a lot of potential business. Let CoverCentric transform your website into a cover-increasing tool that drives new and recurring business through your doors so you can focus on what you do best—creating an amazing dining experience for your guests.</p>
  <h4 class="home-headlines center">CoverCentric specializes in growing <br /> your customer base.</h4>
  <p class="home-copy">Other industries utilize email marketing because it is <a href="www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/why-marketers-should-keep-sending-you-emails">40 times more effective</a> than Twitter or Facebook at acquiring new customers. But this takes special skills, experience, and time that restauranteurs do not have. So leave the marketing and web design to us to ensure you aren’t neglecting a segment that can yield thousands of dollars in revenue per year.</p>
  <h4 class="home-headlines center">Here’s what we’ll do:</h4>
  <p class="home-copy">We will collect email addresses from visitors and build a list that we can email about upcoming events like a holiday party or a happy hour, dramatically increasing turnout. We will even write and send a monthly newsletter that informs your email list of new and exciting developments, a recurring reminder of how great your restaurant is.</p>
  <p class="home-copy">We will improve your website’s search results on Google to help new customers discover your restaurant and giving you a leg up on the competition.</p>
  <p class="home-copy">We will build a new website that focuses on converting visitors into customers through easy-to-read menus, engaging photography, and online reservations. And your site will be optimized for mobile devices, a critical feature since, according to Google, <strong>“50% of people said that even if they like a business, they will use them less often if the website isn't mobile-friendly.”</strong></p>
  <p class="home-copy">We will host, secure, and update your website too so you never have to worry about it.</p>

  <h4 class="home-headlines">You are probably thinking, “This sounds great, but I have some questions...”</h4>
  <ol>
    <li class="objections-questions">Is email marketing really effective?</li>
    <p class="objections-answers">Email marketing provides a greater return on investment than ANY other marketing. But don’t just take
    our word for it. Checkout Campaign Monitor’s <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2016/01/70-email-marketing-stats-you-need-to-know/" class="link-accent">Email Marketing Stats for 2016.</a> Our favorite is #54: <strong id="email-quote">“For every $1 spent,
    email marketing generates $38.”</strong> That’s a return on investment of 3,700%!</p>
    <li class="objections-questions">Can’t I just use a simple website from one of those other providers?</li>
    <p class="objections-answers">Typical web design solutions only focus on the visual, but your website needs to be a
    tool that funnels customers to you restaurant—not just a collection of pages that display hours of operation
    and your location. Our website development is focused on one goal: driving business through your doors. </p>
    <li class="objections-questions">What do you know about the restaurant business?</li>
    <p class="objections-answers">Our founder has worked in all areas of the restaurant business—from dishwasher to line cook to front
    the house management—and we use this experiece to craft marketing campaigns and websites that solve the problems faced by all restaurants. </p>
    <li class="objections-questions">Can I afford to spend $249 per month on a website and online marketing?</li>
    <p class="objections-answers">Yes! Even if our service only drives 10 customers to your restaurant per month (we expect many more) and each one spends $30, that’s $300 in revenue—a 20% return on your investment.</p>
    <li class="objections-questions">What if I am unhappy?</li>
    <p class="objections-answers">Cancel at any time...</p>
